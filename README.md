# Recommendation_system_MF_Deep_Learning_modeling
This project is trying implement recommendation system with Keras API by collaborative filtering methods. The first model is a simple matrix factorization, which the ranking from user i to product j can be expressed as ui dot pj where elements u and p belong to decomposed user and product matrices.
